abstract = {A change in housing prices has a profound impact on households' housing equity and future moving decisions. While most previous studies focus on discussing the mobility lock-in effect due to housing price depreciation, revealing that there is a positive relationship between housing prices and migration, this study reexamines their relationship by using the panel cointegration method and city-level panel data for Taiwan during the 1994–2016 period. The empirical results reveal that migration and housing prices are cointegrated, and the influence of housing prices on migration is significantly positive in the long run. However, the influence of housing price changes on migration is not as significant as expected in the short run. To further examine their short-run relationships, we use quantile regression and the results show that the influence of housing price changes on migration is significantly negative below the 0.5 quantile, but it turns out to be significantly positive in the 0.9 quantile. The influence of housing price changes on migration is not significant between the 0.5 and 0.8 quantiles. We conclude that the influence of housing price changes on migration might be asymmetric in the short run.},

@article{Meijer2013,
abstract = {Aims: To describe the development of a deprivation index for Danish parishes and to investigate its association with all-cause mortality compared with the Townsend index and individual-level factors. Methods: Nine socioeconomic factors were aggregated to the parish level from individual-level register data comprising the entire Danish population in 2005. A principal component analysis was conducted to reduce the number of factors and to apply weights. An ecological analysis investigated the association between the Danish Deprivation Index (DANDEX) and standardised mortality ratios in Danish parishes. Results were compared with the Townsend index and a possible modifying effect of population density was investigated. Sensitivity of the index was investigated with multilevel survival analyses evaluating the association between all-cause mortality and DANDEX, the Townsend Index, individual-level socioeconomic factors, and population density. Results: DANDEX consists of two components measuring socioeconomic properties of all 2119 Danish parishes. The first component measures deprivation related to housing (house and car ownership) while the second component is related to classical measures of socioeconomic status (education, income, occupation). A clear gradient in standardised mortality ratios was seen across quintiles of both index components. Modifying effects were seen when stratifying the index components by population density. In a frailty model, DANDEX accounted for 76{\%} of the between-parish variation in all-cause mortality, while the Townsend index and individual socioeconomic factors accounted for 71 and 76{\%}, respectively.Conclusions: The index can be used to identify Danish parishes by their levels of deprivation and it provides municipalities with a tool to allocate resources to the geographic areas where they are most needed. {\textcopyright} 2013, the Nordic Societies of Public Health.

abstract = {This study applies the bootstrap panel Granger causality test to examine the relationship between housing prices (HPs) and GDP across provinces in China. Empirical results show that HPs Granger cause GDP in the eastern region and in most provinces of the central region. Rapid industrialization and urbanization in the eastern region and the low-cost advantages of the central region promote housing investment and significantly affect GDP. However, GDP has no influence on HPs in the eastern region due to insufficient land supply, housing speculation and HPs deviating from the economic fundamentals. HPs do not Granger cause GDP in the western region because it is less attractive for housing investment. Also, GDP Granger causes HPs in the central and western regions that the economy can influence HPs. These findings could help the government formulate reasonable regional policies for the development of the housing market and economic growth.},

@article{Andersen2010,
abstract = {In most European countries ethnic minorities have had a tendency to settle in certain parts of cities-and often in social housing-together with other immigrants in so-called multiethnic neighbourhoods. An explanation for this could be low income combined with lack of knowledge of the housing market and discrimination, which limits the housing possibilities for ethnic minorities. Another explanation could be that for different reasons immigrants choose to settle in so-called ethnic enclaves where they can find an ethnic social network, which can support them in their new country. In traditional research literature about immigration it has been shown that for many immigrants living in enclaves has been a temporary situation. The 'spatial assimilation theory' says that this situation ends when the family has become more integrated in the new society and then moves to another part of the city. This paper provides evidence to support both explanations of why ethnic minorities move to and from multi-ethnic neighbourhoods. {\textcopyright} 2010 Taylor {\&} Francis.},

abstract = {The popularity of a particular term - the Rotten Banana - has paralleled the one-sided centralisation of public services since the Danish Municipal Reform of 2007. The Rotten Banana denotes peripheral Denmark, which takes a geographically curved form that resembles a banana, and it symbolises the belief that rural areas are backward and (too) costly. This article shows how the negative connotations of rural areas have come to outweigh the positive ones and to legitimise liberal visions of the 'sustainable' welfare state. Whereas previous studies on the perceptions of rural dwellers have focused on the discourses of rurality that produce rural outsiders, this article builds on the work of de Certeau and of Laclau and Mouffe. Based on both quantitative and qualitative data, the study shows how, in Denmark, negative connotations and centralisation have together spurred a new and political mobilisation in many parts of the 'banana'. Through skilful 'consumption', rural dwellers have adapted the alienating liberalist 'logic of equivalence' to their own use and produced a 'logic of difference', thus challenging the predominant political discourse of rurality. As a result, the Danish Liberal government was forced to introduce a new and more inclusive rural policy in September of 2010 and grant rural dwellers a political voice in parliament. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

Current simulation systems face simplifications of personal behaviour, zonal patterns, non-optimisation of public transport trips (choice of the fastest option only), and do not work with real targets and their characteristics. The new TRAMsim system uses a Monte Carlo approach, which evaluates all possible public transport and walking origin-destination (O-D) trips for k-nearest stops within a given time interval, and selects appropriate variants according to the expected scenarios and parameters derived from local surveys. For the city of Ostrava, Czechia, two commuting models were compared based on simulated movements to reach (a) randomly selected large employers and (b) proportionally selected employers using an appropriate distance-decay impedance function derived from various combinations of conditions. The validation of these models confirms the relevance of the proportional gravity-based model. Multidimensional evaluation of the potential accessibility of employers elucidates issues in several localities, including a high number of transfers, high total commuting time, low variety of accessible employers and high pedestrian mode usage. The transport accessibility evaluation based on synthetic trips offers an improved understanding of local situations and helps to assess the impact of planned changes.},

abstract = {This report analyses the patterns of internal migration and population change across the communes of Denmark as part of a multi-country study of regional population dynamics in Europe, comparing the 1980s and 1990s. Section 2 of the report reviews the recent history of internal migration and regional/local population change in Denmark. Section 3 documents data sources and structure. Section 4 provides a detailed cartographic analysis of the patterns of in-migration, out-migration and net-migration at commune level for 1985 and 1998 (the years selected for study), while section 5 reviews population change between 1985 and 1998. Overall net migration shifts have decreased between the two years. The spatial pattern combines losses from peripheral regions (western Jutland, Bornholm) and Copehagen suburbs with gains to commuting belts centred on Copenhagen and the other large towns. As many other high income European countries, there is a profound contrast between the migration behaviour of young people and other adults (families, older workers and the retired). Young people move strongly towards the centre of the capital region and other large towns, while the other groups deconcentrate. Section 6 analyses the relationships between net migration/population change and the settlement system, to calibrate more precisely the patterns observed on the maps, while sections 7 and 8 look at the relationships between internal migration and economic/functional classifications of the communes. The former relationships are stronger than the latter, but are not as well clearly structured with respect to the urban hierarchy or population density as in many other countries studied. Denmark has reached a system state beyond simple counterurbanisation to be characterised by periurbanisation in the Copenhagen region, reurbanisation in Copenhagen itself and moderate outflows from rural regions.},

The development of new net migration data is the first step of a broader JRC project aimed at analysing the relation between climate change, population distribution and related migration. The report uses demographic indirect estimation techniques based on population data from the JRC Global Human Settlement Layer (GHSL) to estimate five-year net migration from 1975 to 2015 at a spatial resolution of about 25 km. Main results of a descriptive analysis of our net migration data are: first, at country level, the aggregation of net migration at 25 km resolution is coherent with UN/DESA Population Prospects estimates for most of the countries worldwide. Second, at international level, urban areas, as resulting from the new and harmonized JRC classification of degrees of urbanization, report a positive net migration, stemming from their attractiveness for immigrants. Third, from an economic perspective, high income countries are those rapidly attracting immigrants, while net migration in low income countries tend to be balanced.},

This paper uses population data from the 1986, 1991, 1996, 2001 and 2006 New Zealand Censuses, house sales price data from Quotable Value New Zealand and rent data from the Department of Building and Housing to examine how population change, international migration, including the return migration of New Zealanders abroad, and internal migration affect rents and sales prices of both apartments and houses in different housing markets in New Zealand. Our analysis focuses on the relationship between the changes in the population in local areas and changes in house sale prices and rents in these areas. Focusing on changes allows us to control for time-invariant unobservable characteristics of local areas that either attract or repel individuals and lead to differential costs of housing.},

Myers proposes the method of longitudinal cohort analysis of repeated cross-sectional data for the study of trends in housing market circumstances. He emphasises the problems and limitations of the use of panel data for such purposes. In this article it is argued that Myers underestimates the potentials of panel data for the study of housing market dynamics over time. Panel data are now relatively easy to obtain and use, also for the analysis of long-term changes in housing markets. Prices and turnover rates in housing markets have been shown to be strongly auto-correlated across geographical space. Therefore, panel data can be used to analyse regional differences in housing markets, even if these data have a relatively small sample size.},

abstract = {Changes in housing demand because of population migration may have a great influence on urban housing prices. The objective of this paper is to investigate how the two aspects of population migration, including inter-regional migration and rural-urban migration, affect housing prices at city level in China. By using the data of the population sampling survey in 2005 and the sixth population census in 2010, a series of empirical studies have been conducted. The results of pooled cross-section data show that an increase in inter-regional migrants by 1{\%} will lead to a rise in housing prices by 0.701{\%} when controlling the other relevant factors. Likewise, an increase in the level of urbanization by 1{\%} will drive up housing prices by 0.343{\%}. Furthermore, the study figures out that the better educated migrants are more likely to affect local housing prices, and the cities with more migrants with higher educational level are expected to experience higher housing prices, which sheds some light on the mechanism of the relationship between migration and housing price. The findings are helpful to China's government in population-related policy making and planning.},

Our instrumental-variables estimates suggest that between 2000 and 2010, immigration led to an average 1.5 percent annual increase in the working-age population. This was responsible for an annual increase in housing prices of about 2 percent, and for a 1.2-1.5 percent increase in housing units. Overall, immigration was responsible for one quarter of the increase in prices and about half of the construction activity over the decade. {\textcopyright} 2012, Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

While most previous studies focus on discussing the mobility lock-in effect due to housing price depreciation, revealing that there is a positive relationship between housing prices and migration, this study reexamines their relationship by using the panel cointegration method and city-level panel data for Taiwan during the 1994–2016 period. The empirical results reveal that migration and housing prices are cointegrated, and the influence of housing prices on migration is significantly positive in the long run. However, the influence of housing price changes on migration is not as significant as expected in the short run. To further examine their short-run relationships, we use quantile regression and the results show that the influence of housing price changes on migration is significantly negative below the 0.5 quantile, but it turns out to be significantly positive in the 0.9 quantile. The influence of housing price changes on migration is not significant between the 0.5 and 0.8 quantiles. We conclude that the influence of housing price changes on migration might be asymmetric in the short run.},

abstract = {With increasingly high housing prices, the urban housing problem has changed from an economic issue to a livelihood issue in China. Taking 32 major cities in China as an example, this paper employed data from 2007 to 2016 to build a panel data model to empirically study the impact of population migration on urban housing prices. From the two perspectives of the national level and regional level (eastern region, central region and western region), the results of this study showed that (1) on the national level, population inflow had a significant positive correlation with urban housing prices, where a population inflow rate increase of 1{\%} increased urban housing prices by 0.31{\%}; and (2) on the regional level, a population inflow rate increase of 1{\%} increased urban housing prices in the eastern region by 1.34{\%}, but population inflow had no obvious impact on the urban housing prices in the central and western regions. Based on the results, this study suggested addressing housing supply imbalances through housing product diversification and affordable housing system improvement, and addressing construction land supply imbalances by building a perfect system linking land-use planning to population; at the same time, it also suggested building more nationally central cities following the urbanization trend, and taking this as the key to developing urban agglomerations, reasonably decentralizing the population flow, promoting the healthy and stable development of the real-estate market and advancing sustainable urbanization. The above conclusions have practical significance for China and other developing countries to coordinate population and urban development in the process of rapid urbanization.},

abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to estimate long-run elasticities for housing prices in Tehran's (capital of Iran) 20 different zones relative to several explanatory variables available for use such as land price, total substructure area, material price, etc. Moreover, another goal of this paper is to propose a new approach to deal with problems which arise due to a lack of proper data. Design/methodology/approach: The data set is gathered from "The Municipality of Tehran" and "The Central Bank of Islamic Republic of Iran (CBI)". One-way fixed effects and one-way random effects approaches (which are panel data approaches) are applied to model housing price forecasting function in Tehran's 20 different zones. Results are compared with ordinary least squares approach which is a common approach in this field. Finally, outcomes of the preferred approach are discussed and analyzed with regard to the economic point of view. Findings: Results show that one-way fixed effects approach provides more accurate forecasts and can be considered as a suitable tool to deal with housing price forecasting problems in environments which are: uncertain, complex, and faced with a lack of proper data. Moreover, it is found that land price is the most effective factor that has impact on total housing cost in Tehran, i.e. the main portion of house prices in Tehran is affected by land price, so appropriate policies have to be made by the government to control fluctuations of this factor. Practical implications: The proposed approach will supply policy makers with improved estimations with decreased errors in uncertain and complex environments which are faced with a lack of proper data, and it extracts valuable information which enables policy makers for handling non-linearity, complexity, as well as uncertainty that may exist in actual data sets with respect to housing price forecasting. Moreover, the proposed approach can be applied to similar housing price case studies to obtain more accurate and more reliable outcomes. Originality/value: Applying panel data approach for estimation of housing prices is relatively new in the field of housing economics. Moreover, this is the first study which employs panel data approach for analyzing the housing market in Tehran. {\textcopyright} Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract = {The impact of migration on local communities and economies is one of the most important and contentious issues of our time. One particular area of policy concern is the extent to which migration results in an increase in house prices, and whether these effects are consistent across different types of location, ranging from large urban areas, to small urban and rural areas. We contribute to the small but growing literature on migration and housing by examining the impact of migration on house prices at different locations in Sweden. Our model, estimated using IV with a shift-share instrument, allows us to disaggregate the effects of labour migration, family reunification migration, and humanitarian migration, as well as to quantify the effect of internal migration. Using data for 284 municipalities over the period 2000-2015, we find that a 1{\%} increase in the foreign-born population results in a 0.8{\%} increase in house prices, which increases to 1.2{\%} if internal migration is also accounted for, allowing us to account for the effects of the displacement of existing residents. Our results also show that the more skilled labour migrants have a large and positive effect on house prices in large urban areas, while refugees, who are often low-skilled, younger, and less wealthy, have a large effect on house prices in the mainly peripheral, rural or small urban areas where they are placed by the government.},

abstract = {Identifying the local interactions between housing prices and population migration is complicated by their simultaneous and spatially interdependent relationship. Higher housing prices may repel households and push them into neighboring areas, suggesting that separately identifying interactions within versus across local neighborhoods is important. Aggregate data and standard econometric models are unable to address the multiple identification problems that may arise from the simultaneity, spatial interaction, and unobserved spatial autocorrelation. Such problems can generate biased estimates that run counter to economic theory. Using Michigan census tract-level data, we estimate a spatial simultaneous equations model that jointly considers population change and housing values, while also explicitly modeling interactions within neighborhoods, spatial interactions across neighborhoods, and controlling for unobserved spatial correlations. After controlling for simultaneity and spatial autocorrelation, the results show that neighborhoods are likely to experience an increase in their housing values if they gain population and they are more likely to lose population if they experience an increase in housing values. Our results are consistent with theory and underscore the importance of accounting for spatial interdependencies between population change and housing values. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.},

The comparison is focused on core (metropolitan) and non-core (non-metropolitan) regions. The study found that the development processes of the analysed groups of regions were in many respects similar. Achieving a high level of development in the context of post-socialist transformation was possible mainly owing to exogenous factors such as the influx of foreign direct investment (FDI) and multimodal transport accessibility. In the case of endogenous factors, the number of small- and medium-sized enterprises per capita was of cardinal importance for a high level of development, but it was no guarantee of fast growth dynamics in non-core regions. The main differences between the core and non-core regions included the role of human capital and migrations as metropolitan regions represented growth poles which trained qualified specialists and served as destinations for migrants from non-core regions. However, the share of people with tertiary education played an important role in the development process of non-core regions. The crisis strengthened the role of exogenous growth factors, that is, the role of FDI inflow as well as the role of EU funds.},

In resource-poor settings, recent and reliable demographic data at subnational scales can often be lacking. National population and housing census data can be outdated, inaccurate, or missing key groups or areas, while registry data are generally lacking or incomplete. Moreover, at local scales accurate boundary data are often limited, and high rates of migration and urban growth make existing data quickly outdated. Here we review past and ongoing work aimed at producing spatially disaggregated local-scale population estimates, and discuss how new technologies are now enabling robust and cost-effective solutions. Recent advances in the availability of detailed satellite imagery, geopositioning tools for field surveys, statistical methods, and computational power are enabling the development and application of approaches that can estimate population distributions at fine spatial scales across entire countries in the absence of census data. We outline the potential of such approaches as well as their limitations, emphasizing the political and operational hurdles for acceptance and sustainable implementation of new approaches, and the continued importance of traditional sources of national statistical data.},

The model implies that if population density is on an upward trajectory, rises in population and in incomes increasingly generate price responses and diminishing rises in the stock of housing. Rises in population density make high and rising levels of house prices likely; this makes alternatives to standard debt financing of home ownership become more desirable.

The rate of household formation has increased with strong population growth, due to elevated rates of natural increase and net migration, and lack of growth in average household size, due to a rise in single-person households with population ageing. This paper presents an overlapping generations model of housing, endogenous labour, savings and growth to analyse the effect of an increase in the household formation rate and speculative demand under rational expectations on house prices in a general equilibrium. We find that real house prices rise over time if the rate of household formation outstrips the rate of housing supply, but do not follow a speculative bubble path in the long run. The results explain why the upward trend in real house prices reflects market fundamentals and has continued despite population ageing as the number of working and retired households grows relative to the number of older people seeking to sell.},

abstract = {The main aim of this study was to identify the factors responsible for Polish property buyers' choice of residential location, including single-family houses and apartments. The following thesis was formulated: analysis of consumers' residential preferences based on their personal experience supports a more reliable evaluation of individual attributes of a residential location. This paper overviews the existing literature on the subject and analyzes primary data collected by the computer-assisted web-interviewing (CAWI) method. The questionnaire developed by the authors was completed by 269 residents of three Polish regions. The respondents evaluated the quality of their residential environment and identified environmental factors that could influence their health. The data were processed statistically to reveal that price is the most important factor behind the residential location choice. Other factors identified by the respondents included the sense of security and a quiet neighborhood. High scenic value was regarded as a moderately important factor, although its significance was recognized by the majority of the respondents.},

abstract = {The relationships among three groups of variables - environmental conditions in residential neighborhoods, post-occupancy housing changes and modifications (HCMs), and the market values of residential properties - are investigated. While traditional hedonic modeling assumes the existence of direct links between environmental factors and property values, this paper suggests that such links are indirect and work through the investment decisions of homeowners, who choose to invest (or not to invest) in the maintenance and/or expansion of their properties. To verify this assumption, HCMs accumulated in four residential neighborhoods in Haifa, Israel are analyzed. The findings indicate a fairly strong association between environmental factors, building characteristics, rehabilitation activity and property values in these neighborhoods. The paper suggests an extra benefit for improving the environment, due to the dynamic process that may cause further investment.},

abstract = {Generally, it is considered that individual housing quality and the convenience of location are main factors when people purchase their houses. Local governments in Japan that promote housing transaction also place importance on the convenience of location, and they do not make effective policy which consider importance on other factors such as the environmental aspect of houses and housing area. This study investigated the factors that influence housing transaction prices in local cities in Japan, and the results will be expected to contribute for making local housing policy considering environmental aspects. The study analyzed recent housing transactions of some local cities located about 100 km north of the centre of Tokyo with a population from about two hundred thousand to five hundred thousand, e.g. Utsunomiya City, using open data that contains transaction prices and various attribute of residential. We estimated hedonic prices and reveal characteristics of each region considering individual housing quality, the convenience of location and the environmental factors. In addition, we conducted a questionnaire survey in multiple detached house areas in Utsunomiya City to clarify the factor of housing choice on the consumer side. The result showed that proximity from the station did not always boost house prices. Moreover, there may be an optimal building density for the city. From the results of the questionnaire, environmental factors have affected to a certain extent on consumer's choice of housing. This study suggested that environmental factors may influence housing selection and price formation. However, information on environmental factors in residential areas is not sufficiently prepared and it is difficult for consumers and residents to obtain it. It will be necessary to prepare it and to create a framework for housing evaluation that considers not only convenience and economy but also environmental factors.},

abstract = {Economic theory predicts that individual migration decisions for working-age adults will depend on area differences in wages, housing costs, and amenities. While the importance of wages and amenities is well-established from previous empirical studies, evidence regarding housing costs is far less conclusive. We develop and test a new method for representing housing prices in migration analyses. We first provide conditions under which utility-maximizing housing costs can be specified as a function of individual characteristics, similar to a Mincerian wage equation. Using large samples of individuals from the 2000 PUMS, we estimate the relationship between housing costs and individual attributes for each of 291 metropolitan areas in the U.S. Our approach accounts for rental and ownership decisions, the costs of rental and owned properties, and the costs of holding housing capital. We test our housing cost measure using observations of point-to-point migration decisions for a large sample of college-educated males. Our migration model includes additional controls for the wage each individual expects to earn in each area as well as a large set of area amenities. Our key finding is that our proposed housing cost measure yields the expected results (higher housing prices reduce the probability that an area is selected). We re-estimate the model using three alternative metropolitan area measures of housing costs: median house price, average apartment rent, and average urban land rent. These measures consistently produce counterintuitive positive effects of housing costs on area choice.},

abstract = {Population density is heterogeneous, and using large spatial areas as a basis for estimates from highly urbanised areas leads to unrepresentative values. This work shows that population density estimated at the census district level (average 225 dwellings) in Canberra, Australia, poorly reflects dwelling types. Data at the individual block level (net or gross block area) greatly improve the estimates. Eight typical dwelling types in Canberra are used to show that there is a relationship between building form and estimated population density only when population density is calculated using the ‘net block' area. To estimate population density at a finer scale than census district, the number of occupants in individual dwellings must be estimated. Assuming a city-wide constant occupancy rate in all dwelling types results in a twofold overestimation of population density in high-density dwellings. Fitting a polynomial function to the occupancy-rate and block-area data for different dwelling types of the city also provides a closer estimate than a categorical (step-wise) estimate; the occupancy rate estimate is then easily calculated from a single variable, the mean gross block size in the census district where the dwelling is located. In high-density dwellings in Canberra (e.g. more than 10 storeys), the occupancy rate was approximately 1.3 people per dwelling and in low-density dwellings (e.g. {\textgreater} 1000 m 2 per dwelling) the occupancy rate approached 2.8 people. This work is of value to researchers and planners who use measures of population density for assessing, for example, the per capita resource sustainability of different buildings.},

In this paper, we examine the power of applying the hedonic method to the spatial- statistical analysis of housing prices in Shanghai. The data we use covers all new commercial residential housings sold in Shanghai during July 2004 and June 2006. The main focus in this paper is to examine the effect of geographical distance to city centre on the selling price of residential housings in Shanghai. We also discuss how the price gradient varies at different directions in Shanghai. Finally, we demonstrate the importance of applying quality control on the development of a housing price index. The statistical methodology and empirical results obtained in this paper carry interesting implications for other cities in China as well.},

To allow for price developments that can differ by quality, we use a recently developed generalization of the conventional Muth model that assumes a constant unit price across the quality spectrum. It allows us to separately consider the development of house prices and quality in Copenhagen neighbourhoods. Moreover, we investigate the validity of the common assumption of a constant unit price and reject it decisively. We use detailed housing transaction data for the greater Copenhagen area. We show that the housing boom of the 2000's and the bust that followed hit the lowest quality segments significantly harder than the high quality segments of the housing market.},
